Project Proposal  

Formula SAE Electric Car 

 

 

Introduction: Mackenzie 

This proposal outlines the design and implementation of a new Battery Management System (BMS) for a Formula SAE Electric Car. A BMS is a critical component for performance, safety, and longevity in electric vehicles, particularly in a competitive racing environment. An optimally optimized BMS will manage the state of charge, state of health, temperature control, and cell balancing of the battery pack. This system will significantly enhance the efficiency and safety of the electric car, rendering it a viable contender in the Formula SAE race. This report presents the design methodology, specifications, success criteria, resources required, and project schedule. In addition, it will also examine ethical and social concerns involving the design and deployment of the BMS and its impact on the broader customer- Tennessee Technological University’s Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department.  

 

Formulating the Problem: Jordan and Mackenzie 

The SAE Electric Competition requires teams to design and build an electric race car with high performance, endurance, and safety specifications. Among the most critical components of this system is the battery pack, which must supply energy for high-speed operation while maintaining durability throughout the competition. In addition, safety is paramount to guarantee the well-being of the driver, team, and university facilities against possible risks of overheating, short circuits, or battery failure. 

  

Off-the-shelf batteries available are too expensive, too heavy, or do not have the power and longevity required for a competitive race. Given these limitations, the SAE team and ECE Department must design a custom battery system that will have the capacity to sustain power output required for racing and still be lightweight in order to improve vehicle efficiency and handling. The battery must also be economically saving, reducing economic cost compared to pre-assembled counterparts, and possess a fine Battery Management System (BMS) for monitoring performance and preventing hazardous failures. 

  

Achieving this goal entails a multi-member engineering team task in performance optimization, weight minimization, cost feasibility, and satisfaction of safety requirements. The team must develop innovative solutions in replicating batteries, supplying a backup or improved version of the current system. Overcoming these challenges, the team aims to develop a custom battery solution for maximizing the car's competitive edge while ensuring safety and economic feasibility, hence enabling successful entry in the SAE Electric Competition. 

Background 

The Formula SAE Electric Competition requires teams to design and build an electric race car that meets stringent performance and safety requirements. A key component of this system is the battery, which must provide sufficient power for high-speed operation while maintaining endurance throughout the competition. Additionally, the battery system must incorporate safety features to protect both the driver and the facilities where the vehicle is stored and maintained. 

 

Specifications and Constraints  

Specifications 

The specifications for this project are defined by stakeholder requirements to ensure optimal performance and competitiveness. If any specification proves unattainable, discussions and negotiations with stakeholders will be necessary to find viable alternatives. The primary requirements include designing a battery that meets or exceeds the performance of the Zero Motorcycle battery, ensuring sufficient power, endurance, and efficiency for competitive racing. Additionally, the electric race car must achieve performance metrics comparable to the ICB car, maintaining competitive speed, handling, and overall functionality. Meeting these specifications will require strategic engineering decisions, careful material selection, and system optimization to balance performance, weight, safety, and cost efficiency. 

 

Constraints 

The project must also adhere to external constraints, including regulatory compliance with governing bodies and industry standards, environmental and safety considerations, and economic feasibility and resource limitations. Consequently, the constraints explicitly model specific degradation mechanisms, such as lithium plating, lithium depletion, overheating, and stress fracture. The critical challenges, however, are that these states evolve according to a system of nonlinear partial differential equations, and the states are not physically measurable. This paper focuses on the first challenge by utilizing the reference governor concept. The results demonstrate how electrochemical model state information can be utilized to ensure safe operation, while providing opportunities to enhance energy capacity, power, and charge times in Li-ion batteries [10].  

 

Survey of Existing Solutions: Dylan 

There are several methods for implementing a battery management system. 

The current zero motors battery has its own battery management system which we will have trick to get it to work with the current vehicle [9]. It should be noted that much of the motorcycle to which the battery was connected is now discarded, so determining the conditions under which the battery must be subjected to run is that much more complex. 

If we decide to make a new battery, we will also need to implement a battery management system that prevents the battery from operating in conditions other than optimal to prevent battery overheating, battery damage during charging or operating, and sudden fires in accordance with the formula SAE rules. 

We can buy one of the batteries offered by the major companies supporting the electric vehicle SAE competition, however, there are some serious issues with doing this. If we choose this method, we will need to implement our own battery management system almost regardless of the battery bought. The formula SAE electric vehicle competition has a serious problem with battery fires occurring at their event. The batteries offered are heavier than the Zero Motors battery which will make the endurance event harder.  

Measure of Success: Everyone 

The project’s success will be evaluated based on the development of a BMS that effectively monitors and regulates battery performance, achievement of a power-to-weight ratio that meets or exceeds competition requirements, compliance with all safety regulations and successful mitigation of potential hazards, and completion of a fully functional and testable BMS for the Formula SAE Car. 

Resources: Maddox  

Budget- Mark said that this battery could cost $10,000 to build, and the E-bike cost around $10,000 itself. However, we do not have those types of resources. Therefore, we will need to utilize the maximum capacity of our budget while also being as cheap as possible. This will mean that we will be keeping to a tight budget and tracking everything. The more we can track, the cheaper we can be. We should be able to do this by keeping our excess materials as small as possible. In addition, if we can extend and use past components as long as possible. 

Personnel- We have the privilege of working parallel with the ECE Capstone group that is in their second semester of this project. Therefore, we will be reviewing and applying their work from last semester along with this semester to our project. This should be very beneficial in jump starting our project. In addition, we have five members in our group who plan to work extensively on advancing this project as close to completion as possible. I believe we have an intelligent group that is going to push each other towards one common goal. Finally, with having a defined customer, supervisor, and buyer, we have the advantage of being able to direct our undivided attention to our product from the start! 

Timeline- The timeline to completion is not completely determined yet. However, our group will be working until December 2025. We plan to recreate the E-bike battery from scratch. The goal is to recreate it, and in addition, make it better. If we could recreate the battery management system, and get the car ready to drive, our goals would be accomplished.  

 

Specific implication: Mackenzie 

What follows highlights the significant, realistic benefits the Formula SAE Electric Car team will gain by implementing a BMS. These will directly reflect performance, safety, and efficiency in the car to obtain good results during races. The BMS will result in optimized energy distribution and balance on the battery cells to ensure that each cell is kept within its operational optimal parameters and race regulations. This will result in a more efficient usage of energy from the battery, thereby giving more output to the car for power and driving range. The car will be able to maintain consistent performance throughout the race, even under varying power demands, such as during acceleration or cornering. 

The protection of the occupants is one of the most essential issues in a racing environment. The BMS will provide continuous monitoring of battery state of charge, state of health, and temperature. A BMS using real-time protective measures such as overcharge, undercharge, and thermal protection reduces the chances of battery failure or hazardous situations like overheating or fire. This would be a guarantee that not only is the car safe, but the driver and some very valuable components are protected. 

The BMS will also enable better energy efficiency by actively controlling the charge-discharge cycles for each cell, ensuring maximum power in the car during the race. It shall also add some longevity to the battery pack by reducing the frequent need for their replacement, an expensive affair to deal with. The BMS will provide the team with real-time telemetry about the car battery performance during the race. It also helps optimize energy consumption, gives the performance settings of the car with regards to conserving battery power when needed and points out areas that need improvement.  

The outcome of such will be that BMS shall offer an efficient, safe, and reliable battery management solution for Formula SAE Electric Car Team to meet high expectations regarding performance of a car, so that it be adequately prepared in all aspects related to competitive success. The increased chance of producing better competition results gives value and makes such investment worthwhile for the customer.  

Broader Implications, Ethics, and Responsibility as Engineers: Marisol 

The focus of this section is solely on the broader implications and ethical issues of electric vehicle batteries, no other components are considered. 

Battery powered electric vehicles present significant environmental benefits compared to internal combustion engines, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels. However, the production, use, and disposal of batteries for electric vehicles raises ethical, environmental, and social concerns. As engineers, it is our responsibility to address these issues while developing sustainable and ethical solutions. 

In terms of broad global and economic implications, the economic benefits of battery production are primarily enjoyed by industrialized nations, while resource-rich developing countries bear the environmental and social costs of extraction [3]. Mining operations raise serious ethical concerns due to reports of child labor and, in general, unsafe work conditions [4,6]. Another aspect to consider regarding the extraction of lithium and cobalt for batteries is the environmental impact which leads to deforestation, water depletion, and pollution, affecting ecosystems and biodiversity [8]. Improper handling and storage of batteries has led to human loss [5]. Additionally, inefficient recycling technologies and improper disposal practices also has led to hazardous waste, leaching toxic substances into soil and water, further complicating the sustainability of electric vehicle batteries [6,7].  

To mitigate these issues, engineers must work with policymakers to implement and enforce stricter environmental and social standards in mining operations which will reduce negative impacts on ecosystems and communities. Further research must be done to advance battery recycling technologies which can improve the efficiency of lithium-ion battery reuse, reducing reliance on newly mined materials. Additionally, increasing consumer awareness, enhancing battery designs, enforcing regulations, and promoting fire prevention measures will help mitigate safety risks associated with lithium-ion batteries.  

In conclusion, engineers have a responsibility to develop sustainable solutions by prioritizing ethical sourcing, minimizing environmental harm, and advocating for fair labor practices. It is our team’s immediate responsibility to safely handle, store, and dispose of our product as well as to be aware of the broader issues here in mentioned.

attendance: all

achievements: 
  -Marisol: Eddited contributions of group members, updated gnat chart, and editted constraints
  -Dylan: Battery annalysis: cylindrical and thin film cell as option for the battery cells
  -Jordan: precharging circuit specification anaylsis
  -Madox: failed to meet with mark

Met with Mark impromptu

resumed 4/7/2025
attendance: all
achievements:
  -Dylan - listed battery options for presentation slides
  -Marisol - listed reasons why the zero battery is not formula sae rule compliant
  -Maddox - argument for using the zero motors's  battery cells
  -Jordan - argued for using the zero battery as is with some modifications
  -Mackenzie - Elaborated on reasons why we can't use the battery as is. Worked on conceptual design- changed constraints based on comments by Micah.

talked about battery options:
if we are able to cut out the cells we can use the zero motor's battery.
We need something for our capstone project.
We could also buy the tesla battery but it leaves little work for the capstone.

goals:
  Maddox - be ready to present using the zero motors's  battery cells
  Dylan - be ready to present other battery options for presentation slides
  Jordan -  be ready to present using the zero battery as is with some modifications
  Marisol - work on the hardware block diagram for conceptual design; be ready to present reasons why the zero battery is not formula sae rule compliant
  MacKenzie - be ready to present reasons why the zero battery is not formula sae rule compliant
  

  All: take the next assignment from Micah and finish it; work on conceptual design

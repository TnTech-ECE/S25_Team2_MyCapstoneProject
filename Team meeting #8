Team meeting #8

attendance:

starts 3:00 p.m. 3/24/2025

to do: vote on type of battery material used: Lithium ion or lithium manganese cobalt (NMC) decided find a potentially better battery cell: marisol
voted to impliment a temperature based limiting current behaviour of the battery management system. - passed.
get in touch with Mark Davis to figure out what specifically he wants in the battery and battery management system for the conceptual design.-maddox allowable dimmensions, zero motors electrical characteristics and tollerances and what specifically he is looking for in the conceptual design. 

sensors for battery management system: dylan


Acheivements: completed relevant sections of the conceptual design 
updated the flow chart: Marisol
updated the comparison of potential solutions: Dylan
updated the specifications of subsystems: Jordan
Added reviewers: Mackenzie

goals:
maddox: work on circuit design for the detailed design and keep track of resources. Discharge circuit.
marisol: power distribution circuit
jordan: charging circuit

dylan: battery design and sensors.
mackenzie: figure out the required arrangment of battery cells to meet the eletcrical characteristics. Find an insulating material.

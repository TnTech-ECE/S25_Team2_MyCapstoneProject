Car name: Kachow

Notes: 
  We went over the gist of the project given to us from the lecture presentations. 
  Also, we looked at the racing car online on TnTech Motorsports which has been entered in Formula SAE Michigan race.
  We further discussed the project proposal from the slides given previously.
  We came to the conclusion that we would work together as well as separately on each part of the proposal to get everyone's input and feedback.

Progress: 
  We discussed talking with Mark Davis, our advisor, the ECE Fall 2024, and the ME groups.
  For the project to have a better understanding, Mackenzie has reached out to both Mark Davis and Dr. Byron Pardue.
  She has only received an answer from Dr.Pardue. 
  Dr. Pardue suggested we have a monthly meeting with the ME group of Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 to make sure we are on the same page all the time. 
  We are still waiting on an answer from Mark Davis and the team capitan Evan Morse. 
  With no answer so far, we will be going to his office to see if we can set up a time to start the project proposal,
  and have an idea on what needs to be accomplished by us. 

Meeting ended at 3:50 p.m.

What is an SAE Electric vehicle?

It is a completely electric vehicle that is open wheeled and single seater.

The vehicles are judged on a number of characteristics:
Static events: - happens once, does't change from the competition
Design                   -150
cost and manufacturing   -100
Presentation             -75
Dynamic Events: - happens during the competition
Acceleration             -100
skipad (cornering)       -75
autocross (preformance)  -125
fuel economy             -100
endurance event          -275
for a total of 1000 points possible.

There are some rewards given for specific design accomplishments.

Braking, rollover stability, and noise levels are checked before the vehicle can be entered into the competition.

The accumulator (battery pack) cannot have a voltage over 600 V
No more than 80 kW may be drawn.

An electrical safety form must be completed before the vehicle can be entered into the competition.


There are no weight requirements, however, lower weight is better. The average car weighs less than 440 lbs.

A safety circuit is part of the car such that if it is removed the car is isolated from the accumulator.
